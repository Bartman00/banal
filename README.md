Bridge Analysis

## What is it?
banal is a simple 2D analysis engine intended for structural analysis of bridges.

It is mostly being created for me to get the experience developing my github and development skills with a topic I'm already familiar with.

## Supported components
As of June 9, 2025 I am just getting started. The plan is to develop:
1. 2D Nodes
2. Truss, beam, and beam-column elements.
3. Support boundary conditions.
4. Nodal, concentrated beam, and uniform beam elements.

## Future developments
Placed roughly in the order I'd like to build them.
1. Moving loads.
